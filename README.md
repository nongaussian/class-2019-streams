# Processing Data Streams in IoT Devices

Tremendous and potentially infinite volumes of data streams are often generated by real-time surveillance systems, communication networks, Internet traffic, on-line transactions in the financial market or retail industry, electric power grids, industry production processes, scientific and engineering experiments, remote sensors, and other dynamic environments. Unlike traditional data sets, stream data flow in and out of a computer system continuously and with varying update rates. They are temporally ordered, fast changing, massive, and potentially infinite. It may be impossible to store an entire data stream or to scan through it multiple times due to its tremendous volume. Moreover, stream data tend to be of a rather low level of abstraction, whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamic changes, such as trends and deviations. To discover knowledge or patterns from data streams, it is necessary to develop single-scan, on-line, multilevel, multidimensional stream processing and analysis methods. In this class, we treat such tasks as advanced topics in data mining.
